# instacart-analysis-Python
Data analysis using Python to perform exploratory tasks to derive insights and make suggestions.
## **Objectives**
Instacart is an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task was to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.
## **Context**
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
